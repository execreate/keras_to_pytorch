# Trasfer pre-trained weights from Keras model to a PyTorch model

## Getting started

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8 using [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html)
or [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This repository uses [PlaidML](https://github.com/plaidml/plaidml) backend for
[Keras](https://keras.io). If you wish to use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
install it with [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

[TBD]
